In particular, we'll simulate [Rule 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30), a one-dimensional cellular automaton rule introduced by Stephen Wolfram in 1983. It is particularly interesting because it produces complex, seemingly random patterns from simple, well-defined rules.\n",

    "* The stochastic Rule 30 produces markedly different patterns compared to the deterministic simulation, even though both use identical underlying rules. The introduction of probabilistic state transitions and cooldown periods fundamentally alters the system's evolution, creating patterns that appear more fragmented and sparse than their deterministic counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of the smooth, continuous triangular expansion seen in the deterministic case, the stochastic simulation generates interrupted patterns with gaps and isolated clusters of activity. The probabilistic nature means that not every cell updates at each time step, creating a stuttering effect where pattern propagation becomes irregular and unpredictable. This leads to regions where the characteristic Rule 30 structures are broken or delayed, resulting in a more heterogeneous overall appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The cooldown mechanism introduces temporal dependencies that don't exist in the deterministic version, where recently updated cells must wait before participating in future transitions. This creates additional complexity and can lead to the formation of transient stable regions where activity becomes temporarily suppressed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The overall pattern retains some recognizable Rule 30 characteristics but with significantly more variability and less predictable boundaries, demonstrating how stochastic elements can dramatically alter emergent behavior while preserving the underlying mathematical structure.\n",
